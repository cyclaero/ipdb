.Sh DESCRIPTION
In general, access control by the firewall is established by selectors that can be attributed to incoming and outgoing IP-packets,
like physical interfaces on which the packets are going, source and target IP addresses, protocol types, port numbers, content types
and content, etc. The geo-location would be just another selector, but this information is not carried explicitly with the IP packets,
however, it can be obtained using the source IP address as a key for looking-up the location in a geo-database. For example, besides
other information, the country to which a given IP address is delegated, can be obtained with the common unix tool \fBwhois\fP(1).
.Pp
\fBwhois\fP does an online lookup in the databases of the 5 \fBR\fPegional \fBI\fPnternet \fBR\fPegistries (AFRINIC, APNIC, ARIN, LACNIC, RIPENCC),
and this is the most reliable way to obtain the country code for a given IP address, because the RIR's are the authorities for
internet number delegations. Unfortunately, online database lookup is by far too slow for even thinking about being utilized
on the firewall level, where IP packets need to be processed in a 10th or a 100th of a millisecond. Therefore, a locally maintained
Geo-IP database is indispensable in the given respect, and the \fBipdbtools\fP(1) are designed to provide this on FreeBSD:
.Bl -tag -width " - ipdb-update.sh "
.It \ - \fBipdb-update.sh\fP
A shell script for updating the geoip database by downloading the latest delegation statistics files of the 5 RIR's.
.It \ - \fBipdb\fP
A tool for consolidating the IP address ranges from the RIR delegation statistics files into binary sorted tables, suitable for
direct utilization by the very fast bisection search algorithm of the geoip lookup tool.
.It \ - \fBgeoip\fP
A tool for manually looking up an IP address on the command line, and for generation of CIDR conforming IP tables
per country code that are ready to use for IP table based actions by \fBipfw\fP(8).
.El
.Sh Setting up the local Geo-IP database
The authoritative Geo-IP information must be obtained from the 5 RIR's, and compiled into an optimized format suitable for quickly
looking up the country codes of given IP addresses. This information is present in so called delegation statistics files on the
ftp servers of each RIR, and APNIC, LACNIC and RIPENCC mirror the files of the other RIR's on their servers - as of the date
of this writing, ARIN and AFRINIC do not mirror current delegation statistics of the other RIR's.
.Pp
1) Choose one of the three useful mirror sites, depending on where you are located:
.Bl -tag -width "   ftp.ripencc.net "
.It \ \ \ \fBftp.ripencc.net\fP
RIPENCC -- Europe and Eurasia [default mirror]
.It \ \ \ \fBftp.apnic.net\fP
APNIC -- Asia Pacific
.It \ \ \ \fBftp.lacnic.net\fP
LACNIC -- Latin America and Caribbean
.El
.Pp
2) As user root execute the shell script \fBipdb-update.sh\fP with the chosen mirror as the parameter, for example ftp.apnic.net:
.Pp
# ipdb-update.sh ftp.apnic.net

 Processing RIR data files ...
.sp
  afrinic.dat  apnic.dat  arin.dat  lacnic.dat  ripencc.dat
.sp
 Number of processed IP-Ranges = 112602
.sp
As shown above, this would download the delegation statistics data together with MD5 hashes for integrity checking into the directory
.Ar /usr/local/etc/ipdb/IPRanges/ .
Then just in the same go, the \fBipdb\fP tool would process the data files and generate two binary sorted table (.bst) files, one for the IPv4 ranges
.Ar /usr/local/etc/IP-Ranges/ipcc.bst.v4
and another one for the IPv6 ranges
.Ar /usr/local/etc/IP-Ranges/ipcc.bst.v6 .
.Sh Quering the local Geo-IP database
Use the
.Nm
tool for the various queries:
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It Fl h
Show the usage instructions.
.It Op Fl r Ar bstfiles
Base path to the binary sorted tables (.v4 and .v6) with the consolidated IP ranges which were generated by the \fBipdb\fP tool [default: \fI/usr/local/etc/ipdb/IPRanges/ipcc.bst\fP].
.It \fBFirst usage form\fP -- CC query:
.It Ao Ar IP_address Ac
IPv4 or IPv6 address for which the country code should be looked up.
.It \fBSecond usage form\fP -- firewall table generation:
.It Fl t Ar CC:DD:.. | CC=nnnnn:DD=mmmmm:.. | CC:DD=ooooo:EE;.. | \*q\*q
Output all IP address/masklen pairs belonging to the listed countries, given by 2 letter capital country codes, separated by colon.
An empty CC list means any country code. A table value can be assigned per country code in the following manner:
-t BR=10000:DE=10100:US:CA:AU=10200. In the case of no assignment, no value or the global value defined by either the -v or the -x option is utilized.
.It Op Fl n Ar table_number
The ipfw table number between 0 and 65534 [default: 0].
.It Op Fl v Ar table_value
A global 32-bit unsigned value for all ipfw table entries [default: 0].
.It Op Fl x Ar offset
Decimal encode the given \fICC\fP and add it to the \fIoffset\fP for computing the table value: value = \fIoffset\fP + ((C1 - 'A')*26 + (C2 - 'A'))*10.
.It Op Fl p
Plain IP table generation, i.e. without ipfw table construction directives, and any -n, -v and -x flags are ignored in this mode.
.It Op Fl 4
Process only the \fIIPv4\fP address ranges.
.It Op Fl 6
Process only the \fIIPv6\fP address ranges.
.It \fBThird usage form\fP -- compute the encoded value of a country code (see -x flag above):
.It Fl q Ar CC
The country code to be encoded.

.br
.sp
.Nm
can be used for Geo-blocking together with \fBipfw\fP(8). For this spurpose,
.Nm
would generate tables of CIDR ranges for the selected country codes, and these tables can be directly piped into \fBipfw\fP(8).
The respective configuration script may contain something like:
.br
.sp
\&.\&.\&.
.br
# allow only web access from DE, BR, US:
.br
/usr/local/bin/geoip -t DE:BR:US -n 7 | /sbin/ipfw -q /dev/stdin
.br
/sbin/ipfw -q add 70 deny tcp from not table\e(7\e) to any 80,443 in recv em0 setup
.br
\&.\&.\&.
.br
.sp
\fBOR\fP vice versa:
.br
.sp
\&.\&.\&.
.br
# deny web access from certain disgraceful regions:
.br
/usr/local/bin/geoip -t TR:SA:RU:GB -n 66 | /sbin/ipfw -q /dev/stdin
.br
/sbin/ipfw -q add 70 allow tcp from not table\(66\) to any 80,443 in recv em0 setup
.br
\&.\&.\&.
.br
.sp
.br
.sp
For keeping the database updated, \fBipdb-update.sh\fP may be executed by a weekly cronjob, for this you might want to add the following entry to /etc/crontab:
.br
.sp
\&.\&.\&.
.br
# weekly update of the IP geo-location databases
.br
\ \ 5    4    *    *    6    root    /usr/local/bin/ipdb-update.sh ftp.apnic.net > /dev/null 2>&1 && /usr/sbin/service geod restart > /dev/null
.br
